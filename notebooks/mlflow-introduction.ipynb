    "This first application introduces the basic concepts of `MLFlow`.

Then, we show how we can integrate it as an **MLflow experiment**, so as to **log** relevant parameters and metrics in `MLflow`'s **tracking server** and visualize them in the UI. Finally, we illustrate how selected models can transition from the tracking server to the **model registry**, and how they can then be used from there to perform inference on new data points."

To do so, we have to **fine-tune** the **hyperparameters** of our model, i.e. find the combination of **hyperparameters** that provide the best performance. In order to avoid **overfitting** when doing so, we use a procedure called **cross-validation** (described in details [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html)). When we have found the optimal set of hyperparameters, we use the model trained with those for a final evaluation on the test set.\n",

For each combination, a performance evaluation is performed using a 5-folds *cross-validation*.

Open a given run and verify that you can retrieve the various information we wanted to log (hyperparameters, evaluation metrics, training data URL), check that you can download the serialized `scikit-learn` model, and check the `requirements.txt` file to understand how `MLflow` automatically inferred the required `Python` environment\n",

    "`MLflow` enables us to **set our machine learning experiments to the standards of the `MLOps` approach** in a very user-friendly way :\n",
    "- data scientists can very easily decide what data they want to log for each experiment so as to **keep a detailed track of those experiments**\n",
    "- other members of the team (e.g. data engineers that might be in charge of deploying the model) can very easily fetch the model and use it for prediction in an application. To do so, they only need to know the name of the model as well as its version or its stage, but not the actual location of the artifact on the storage, as this layer is abstracted by `MLflow`. **This makes collaboration on machine learning projects very convenient and efficient**."
